For that purpose, first the credentials, photos and signature are taken as input in the form and both the photos and signature are stored in a temporal external storage. Then the photo and signature are sent for pre-processing to get it standardized. After standardization of both, SIFT is applied on the photo and OCR is applied on the signature. SIFT or Scale Invariant Feature Transform is used here to extract the visual features of the photo while OCR or Optical Character Recognition is used here to extract the characters (texts) from the signature. OCR is used to detect character of uploaded signature image and SIFT is used to detect the visual feature of uploaded applicant image. Case 1: If the outcome of OCR and SIFT is True then both the images are in correct position. Case 2: If the outcome of OCR is True and the outcome of SIFT is False then sign is in correct position but the photo isn’t. Case 3: Then if the outcome of OCR and SIFT both are False then both the images in wrong position so, we need to swap the images and then recheck them. Case 4: At last if the OCR is False and the SIFT is True then sign is in wrong position and the photo is in correct position. In case 1, for applicant image, capture applicant’s image using live camera, then apply SIFT on the applicant image and verify it. If it is True then store it in an image Database and if it is False then it will generate an error by AI system. For applicant sign, verify it with applicant’s name, if it is True then store it in a signature Database and if it is False then it will generate error by AI system. In case 2, for applicant image, generate error and retake image. For applicant sign, verify it with applicant’s name, if it is True then store it in a signature Database and if it is False then it will generate error by AI system. In case 3, same as case 1. In case 4, for applicant image, capture applicant’s image using live camera, then apply SIFT on the applicant image and verify it. If it is True then store it in an image Database and if it is False then it will generate error by AI system. For applicant sign generate error and retake image.\n","5/2/22, 9:00 AM - Rahul Karmakar: Eta likheche\n","5/2/22, 9:06 AM - Sneha CSE2: Achha achha\n","5/2/22, 10:04 AM - Sneha CSE2: <Media omitted>\n","5/2/22, 10:04 AM -

Character Recognition is a challenging task because it checks the legitimacy of the photo and signature and whether they are in the correct place or not. For that purpose, first the credentials, photos and signature are taken as input in the form and both the photos and signature are stored in a temporal external storage. Then the photo and signature are sent for pre-processing to get it standardized. After standardization of both, SIFT is applied on the photo and OCR is applied on the signature. SIFT or Scale Invariant Feature Transform is used here to extract the visual features of the photo while OCR or Optical Character Recognition is used here to extract the characters (texts) from the signature. OCR is used to detect character of uploaded signature image and SIFT is used to detect the visual feature of uploaded applicant image. Case 1: If the outcome of OCR and SIFT is True then both the images are in correct position. Case 2: If the outcome of OCR is True and the outcome of SIFT is False then sign is in correct position but the photo isn’t. Case 3: Then if the outcome of OCR and SIFT both are False then both the images in wrong position so, we need to swap the images and then recheck them. Case 4: At last if the OCR is False and the SIFT is True then sign is in wrong position and the photo is in correct position. In case 1, for applicant image, capture applicant’s image using live camera, then apply SIFT on the applicant image and verify it. If it is True then store it in an image Database and if it is False then it will generate an error by AI system. For applicant sign, verify it with applicant’s name, if it is True then store it in a signature Database and if it is False then it will generate error by AI system. In case 2, for applicant image, generate error and retake image. For applicant sign, verify it with applicant’s name, if it is True then store it in a signature Database and if it is False then it will generate error by AI system. In case 3, same as case 1. In case 4, for applicant image, capture applicant’s image using live camera, then apply SIFT on the applicant image and verify it. If it is True then store it in an image Database and if it is False then it will generate error by AI system. For applicant sign generate error and retake image.\\n', ' Rahul Karmakar: Eta likheche\\n', ' Sneha CSE2: Achha achha\\n', ' Sneha CSE2: <Media omitted>\\n', ' Sneha CSE2: Bollam naa\\n', ' Sneha
